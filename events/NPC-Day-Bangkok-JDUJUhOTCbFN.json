Instead of boring, flat, agentless characters, we redefine NPCs by their ability to bring digital worlds to life — Autonomous agents, smart contract bots, and NFTs which can use their own wallet to enact change across the EVM.</span></p><p class=\"editor-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><br></p><p class=\"editor-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><i><em class=\"editor-text-italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">NPC Day is part of LabWeek Web3, the decentralized conference by Protocol Labs.</em></i><br></p><p class=\"editor-paragraph\" dir=\"ltr\"><i><em class=\"editor-text-italic\" style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">LabWeek Web3 is designed by builders, for builders, with a focus on securing digital human rights and making the internet more equitable for all.</em></i></p>",
